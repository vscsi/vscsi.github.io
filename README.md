- Used mostly bootstrap components throughout the whole page.

- Custom URL icon, made from favicon. 

### Navbar

- Used a sticky navbar for a more convenient navigation through out the whole page. 

-Written javascript to make the navbar change background colour when it is scrolled down more than 200 px.

- Customed the anchor link hover effect in the css for it to have a colour change effect. 

### Header Content

- Used a jumbotron container to wrap around the header content.
